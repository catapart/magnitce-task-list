## Overview
The `<task-list>` element is a container element for [`<task-card>`](https://github.com/catapart/magnitce-task-card) elements. It provides some basic task list features, like a customizeable header, an add button, the ability to show and hide its items, and a drag-and-drop feature. It also dispatches events when the list contents change.

## Attributes
|Attribute|Effect|
|-|-|
|`name`|Sets the title of the list. Displays as the value of the text input in the list header.|
|`description`|Sets the title text of the list's header. Displays as "title text". Visible upon hovering a pointer over the header.|
|`color`|A color to represent the list. Displays as the value of the color input in the list header. A categorization feature.|
|`collapsed`|If `true`, hides the list items. If `false`, displays the list items.|
|`drag-drop`|Enables drag-and-drop functionality for the list items.|

## Drag and Drop
The `<task-list>` element implements drag-and-drop features by using the native browser events `dragstart`, `dragend`, `dragover`, and `drop`. These events require non-trivial handlers, so the library expects [`<task-card>`](https://github.com/catapart/magnitce-task-card) elements as its list-items. While custom item types can be used, it is not recommended and may not have all of the features.

### `dragAndDropQueryParent` and `parentScopeSelector`
Facilitating moving items between lists means querying outside of the `<task-list>` elements, themselves.  
The `dragAndDropQueryParent` is an element which has a `querySelector()` function run on it to determine valid items for the drag target's (possible) siblings. In effect, this `dragAndDropQueryParent` is any element that contains all of the `<task-list>` elements which items will be able to be dragged-and-dropped between. By default, the `dragAndDropQueryParent` is set to the document's `<body>` element. This means that any `<task-list>` in the document will be considered as a drop target.  
To scope the query smaller, set the `dragAndDropQueryParent` to the first ancestor element that contains all of the `<task-list>` elements on your page.

The `parentScopeSelector` serves the same function as the `dragAndDropQueryParent`, but it is a string value that is used in the selector query. For reference, this is how the actual query looks:
```js
this.dragAndDropQueryParent.querySelector(`${this.parentScopeSelector}${this.TASKCARD_TAG_NAME}[data-drag-id]`);
```
From that snippet, you can see that the two features can actually work together, if you need to dynamically narrow scope from a larger parent scope. But the simplification of all of this is that you can use either an element reference, or a css selector, or both, as a away to scope the `<task-list>` elements when dragging and dropping.

### Customization
#### `[TaskListElement].TASKCARD_TAG_NAME`
The `TASKCARD_TAG_NAME` property of a `<task-list>` element determines the string that will be used to match "card" child elements. By default, this value is set to `<task-card>`, with the expectation of matching [`<task-card>`](https://github.com/catapart/magnitce-task-card) elements.  
To be clear: this is only referenced by the drag-and-drop functionality and can otherwise be ignored.

To use a custom list item, replace the `TASKCARD_TAG_NAME` with whatever the tag name is for the custom list item element.

## Parts
The `<task-list>` element uses the `part` attribute to expose its shadow DOM content to the light DOM both for styling and selecting in javascript.

|Part Name|Description|
|-|-|
|`header`|A `<header>` element containting inputs for the list's color and name, as well as a collapse button, and a `title` attribute set to the list's `description` property.|
|`color-container`|A container for the list's color input. May be used, with custom styling, to display the color while hiding the color input, itself.|
|`color`|An `<input type="color">` element that displays the list's `color` property.|
|`name`|An `<input type="text">` element that displays the list's `name` property.|
|`collapse-button`|A button that toggles the list's collapsed status.|
|`collapse-icon`|An icon on the collapse button to indicate "collapse". Default is `â–²`.|
|`tasks`|The `<ul>` element containing all of the list's items.|
|`add-button`|A button that dispatches the `add` event.|
|`add-icon`|An icon on the add button to indicate "add". Default is `+`.|
|`add-label`|The text on the add button to indicate "add". Default is `Add Task`.|

### `findPart()` and `getPart()`
In addition to being able to select an element from the `<task-list>` element's shadowRoot reference, this element provides a function for selecting one of its parts by using the `findPart()` function.

In this example, the same part is selected with the default shadowRoot reference, and by using the `findPart()` function:
```js
const  = document.querySelector('header');
findPart('').addEventListener('input', (event) =>
{
    // queries the shadowRoot for an element with a part attribute of ""
});
shadowRoot.querySelector('[part="header"]').addEventListener('input', (event) =>
{
    // queries the shadowRoot for an element with a part attribute of ""
});
```
*(note: these two calls do exactly the same thing)*

If one of this element's parts are going to be referenced frequently, the `<task-list>` element's `getPart()` function can be used instead.

With `getPart()`, the element will be cached in RAM for immediate access witout having to perform a DOM query on the shadowRoot.
```js
const  = document.querySelector('');
taskCard.getPart(header'').addEventListener('input', (event) =>
{
    // gets cached element and, if null: queries the shadowRoot for an element with a part attribute of ""
});
taskCard.shadowRoot.querySelector('[part="header"]').addEventListener('input', (event) =>
{
    // queries the shadowRoot for an element with a part attribute of ""
});
```
*(note: these two calls do two different things)*

For event-based or initialization code, `findPart()` should be fine for performance. But if the `<task-list>` element is going to be updated multiple times in a row, the `getPart()` function will provide a smoother experience.

## Events
### `change`
#### Detail
```js
{ 
  target: HTMLElement,
  order?: number,
  previousOrder?: number,
}
```
#### Description

- `order`:  
provides an integer of the item's index in the `<task-list>` element.
- `previousOrder`:  
provides an integer of the item's index in the `<task-list>` element before it was moved to its current position.
- `target`:  
provides the `<task-list>` element or list item that invoked the change.

### `add`
#### Detail
```js
{ 
  order: number
}
```
#### Description
Fires when the "Add" button is clicked.
- `order`:  
provides an integer for assigning to a new task.

### `added`
#### Detail
```js
{ 
  target: HTMLElement,
  order: number,
}
```
#### Description
Fires when a new item is added to a list.
- `order`:  
provides an integer of the item's index in the `<task-list>` element the item was added to.
- `target`:  
provides the `<task-list>` element that the item was added to.

### `removed`
#### Detail
```js
{ 
  target: HTMLElement,
  order: number
}
```
#### Description
Fires when an item is removed from a list.
- `order`:  
provides an integer of the item's index in the `<task-list>` element the item was removed from.

provides the `<task-list>` element that the item was removed from.

### `nested`
#### Detail
```js
{ 
  target: TaskListElement,
}
```
#### Description
Fires when a new `<task-list>` element is added to a parent `<task-list>` element.
- `target`:  
provides the `<task-list>` element that was nested within the parent.

### `collapse`
#### Detail
```js
undefined
```
#### Description
Fires when the `<task-list>` element is collapsed and uncollapsed.

## Slots
The `<task-list>` element allows customization by using slots to inject custom html content into its shadowRoot.

The `<task-list>` element exposes the following `slot`s: 
|Slot Name|Description|Default
|-|-|-|
|`header`|A heading that describes and distinguishes the list's items from other elements on the page.|[HTMLHeaderElement]|
|[Default]|Slot that holds all of the list items.(*note: this slot has no name; all children of the `<task-list>` element that do not specificy a `slot` attribute value will be placed in this default slot.*)|[empty]|
|`add-button`|A button that is used to invoke the `add` event, and indicate that the list needs to have a new item injected.|[HTMLButtonElement]|
|`footer`|An area to include additional content or data about the list. Can also be used for nested `<task-list>` elements.|[empty]|

## Styling
The `<task-list>` element itself, and its items, can all be styled with CSS, normally. Each of the elements in the `<task-list>` element's shadowRoot can be selected for styling, directly, by using the `::part()` selector.

In this example, the `header` part is being selected for styling:
```css
task-list::part(header)
{
    /* styling */
}
```

For a list of all part names, see the [parts](#parts) section.

## `<task-card>` and `<task-board>` elements
The `<task-list>` element is designed as a parent to the [`<task-card>`](https://github.com/catapart/magnitce-task-card) element and a child for the [`<task-board>`](https://github.com/catapart/magnitce-task-board) element.

Neither the `<task-board>` or the `<task-card>` elements are required for the `<task-list>` element to function, but design decisions were made around how these three elements are expected to work together.

For developing custom implementations, the [`<task-board>` demo page](https://catapart.github.io/magnitce-task-board/demo/) gives examples of the three elements used as expected.
